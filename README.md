### Project Descriptions / Project Objectives:
-The objective of this project was to simulate a basic social networking system using C++, without relying on a database.\
-Users can create accounts, log in with their name and password, add or remove friends, send and delete messages, and see received or sent messages.\
-An admin role allows full control over user and message data.\
-The application was built using a modular structure with classes separated by responsibility and custom-built ADTs: a singly linked list for storing users and a multimap to manage user relationships.\
-The interface is command-line based, and all changes persist via file storage.

### Job Description / Responsibilities:
-I developed a console-based social networking application in C++ using object-oriented programming principles and custom abstract data types (ADTs).\
-The system includes a singly linked list to manage registered users and a custom multimap structure to manage user friendships.\
-I implemented a menu-driven interface that allows users to register, log in, manage their friends list, send and delete messages, and view their message history.\
-Data is stored in and loaded from .txt files without the use of a database.\
-The application also includes an administrator role with full access to view, add, edit, and delete users and messages across the platform.

### Achievements / Challenges:
-Built custom ADTs: singly linked list and multimap.\
-Managed persistent data storage using text files.\
-Implemented error handling for duplicate IDs, invalid logins, etc.\
-Developed full user and admin logic for account and message management\
-Practiced modular design and real-world problem-solving in C++
